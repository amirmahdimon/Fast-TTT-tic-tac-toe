# Fast-TTT-tic-tac-toe
The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O. The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game.
